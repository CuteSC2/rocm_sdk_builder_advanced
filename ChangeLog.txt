- Build system improvements
	- cpu count and ram available is checked for trying to adjust the CPU count used
	  during the build time being efficient while not putting the whole system down
	  by running out of memory for example.
	  (Should now use more cpu's on most cases than previous version)
	- Build now checks and warns more clearly if the git configuration
	  is missing or if the read-write permission to amd gpu driver
	  /dev/kfd is not configured properly.
	- Lot of improvements to error messages, code comments and bash code syntax used
	- Fixes for the onnxruntime and deepspeed build
	- Aotriton cpu usage fixes (allocated 2x cpus available and put build systems down)
	- Upstream bug repors and fixes (rocm_smi_lib, pytorch)
- Testing and benchmarks
	- Improved various example codes under docs/examples folder to test
	  pytorch, opencl, onnxruntime, amdmigraphx, etc.
	- pytorch gpu benchmark tests execution improvements in
	  https://github.com/lamikr/pytorch-gpu-benchmark
