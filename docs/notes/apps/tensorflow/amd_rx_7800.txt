Seems to work :) just build tensorflow against ROCm 6.0.2,

had to do minimal changes to the code: https://github.com/ROCm/tensorflow-upstream/commit/1c3f58db55b87b0d30cd2cfefbe3b31a9b8987da

And it just worked :):

Really amazed how far this has evolved! I remember it was quite a hassle at the start of 2023 to get even HIP running on consumer cards / RDNA1 (had a 5700XT back then).. But today: Almost everything works on consumer / RDNA cards :) really happy!

Compared to my CPU i get a 35 fold performance boost while training that simple 3x 4096 Dense network.
