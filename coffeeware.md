**"THE COFFEEWARE LICENSE" (Revision 2):**



Mika Laitio <lamikr@gmail.com> wrote this code in binfo/binfo_list.sh and binfo/envsetup.sh files. As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this code. If we meet some day, and you think 
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a coffee in return.

Also, you might consider mentioning this software in copyright text-part
of your release if you wish to. And And if you'd like you can send me a donation at any time to support my work, ask me how!
